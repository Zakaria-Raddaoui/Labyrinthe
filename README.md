# Labyrinthe
This Python project implements a maze-solving algorithm using both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) to find paths through a randomly generated maze. It utilizes the pyamaze library for maze generation and visualization. The project defines a Graphe class to represent the graph structure of the maze and a SearchLabyrinthe class that handles the maze exploration algorithms.

Key features:

- Graph Representation: Nodes and edges are used to represent the maze's structure.
- BFS and DFS Algorithms: Two classic search algorithms (BFS and DFS) are implemented to explore the maze and find the shortest path.
- Visualization: The maze and the paths found by BFS and DFS are visualized using the pyamaze library, with agents tracing the paths.

You can use this project to explore the efficiency and behavior of BFS and DFS in maze-solving tasks. The visual output provides an intuitive demonstration of the paths taken by both algorithms, and the number of states discovered is displayed for comparison.

Feel free to clone the project and experiment with different maze sizes or search strategies!
